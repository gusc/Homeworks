            <h2><figure></figure>1. anchoring</h2>
            <p class="main">The first thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows.</p>
            <p>Human minds are associative in nature, so the order in which we receive information helps determine the course of our judgments and perceptions. For instance, the first price offered for a used car sets an ‘anchor’ price which will influence how reasonable or unreasonable a counter-offer might seem. Even if we feel like an initial price is far too high, it can make a slightly less-than-reasonable offer seem entirely reasonable in contrast to the anchor price.</p>
            <p>Be especially mindful of this bias during financial negotiations such as houses, cars, and salaries. The initial price offered has proven to have a significant effect.</p>

            <h2><figure></figure>2. the availability heuristic</h2>
            <p class="main">Your judgments are influenced by what springs most easily to mind.</p>
            <p>How recent, emotionally powerful, or unusual your memories are can make them seem more relevant. This, in turn, can cause you to apply them too readily. For instance, when we see news reports about homicides, child abductions, and other terrible crimes it can make us believe that these events are much more common and threatening to us than is actually the case.</p>
            <p>Try to gain different perspectives and relevant statistical information rather than relying purely on first judgments and emotive influences.</p>

            <h2><figure></figure>3. the curse of knowledge</h2>
            <p class="main">Once you understand something you presume it to be obvious to everyone.</p>
            <p>Things makes sense once they make sense, so it can be hard to remember why they didn't. We build complex networks of understanding and forget how intricate the path to our available knowledge really is. This bias is closely related to the hindsight bias wherein you will tend to believe that an event was predictable all along once it has occurred. We have difficulty reconstructing our own prior mental states of confusion and ignorance once we have clear knowledge.</p>
            <p>When teaching someone something new, go slow and explain like they're ten years old (without being patronizing). Repeat key points and facilitate active practice to help embed knowledge.</p>

    <section id="confirm">

        <div>
            <h2><figure></figure>4. confirmation bias</h2>
            <p class="main">You favor things that confirm your existing beliefs.</p>
            <p>We are primed to see and agree with ideas that fit our preconceptions, and to ignore and dismiss information that conflicts with them. You could say that this is the mother of all biases, as it affects so much of our thinking through motivated reasoning. To help counteract its influence we ought to presume ourselves wrong until proven right.</p>
            <p>Think of your ideas and beliefs as software you're actively trying to find problems with rather than things to be defended. "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman</p>

            <h2><figure></figure>5. the dunning-kruger effect</h2>
            <p class="main">The more you know, the less confident you're likely to be.</p>
            <p>Because experts know just how much they don't know, they tend to underestimate their ability; but it's easy to be over-confident when you have only a simple idea of how things are. Try not to mistake the cautiousness of experts as a lack of understanding, nor to give much credence to lay-people who appear confident but have only superficial knowledge.</p>
            <p>“The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are so certain of themselves, yet wiser people so full of doubts.”- Bertrand Russell</p>

        <span class="bg"></span>
        <div>
            <h2><figure></figure>6. negativity bias</h2>
            <p class="main">You allow negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.</p>
            <p>The pain of loss and hurt are felt more keenly and persistently than the fleeting gratification of pleasant things. We are primed for survival, and our aversion to pain can distort our judgment for a modern world. In an evolutionary context it makes sense for us to be heavily biased to avoid threats, but because this bias affects our judgments in other ways it means we aren't giving enough weight to the positives.</p>
            <p>Pro-and-con lists, as well as thinking in terms of probabilities, can help you evaluate things more objectively than relying on a cognitive impression.</p>

            <h2><figure></figure>7. declinism</h2>
            <p class="main">You remember the past as better than it was, and expect the future to be worse than it will likely be.</p>
            <p>Despite living in the most peaceful and prosperous time in history, many people believe things are getting worse. The 24 hour news cycle, with its reporting of overtly negative and violent events, may account for some of this effect. We can also look to the generally optimistic view of the future in the early 20th century as being shifted to a dystopian and apocalyptic expectation after the world wars, and during the cold war. The greatest tragedy of this bias may be that our collective expectation of decline may contribute to a real-world self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
            <p>Instead of relying on nostalgic impressions of how great things used to be, use measurable metrics such as life expectancy, levels of crime and violence, and prosperity statistics.</p>

            <h2><figure></figure>8. the halo effect</h2>
            <p class="main">How much you like someone, or how attractive they are, influences your other judgments of them.</p>
            <p>Our judgments are associative and automatic, and so if we want to be objective we need to consciously control for irrelevant influences. This is especially important in a professional setting. Things like attractiveness can unduly influence issues as important as a jury deciding someone's guilt or innocence. If someone is successful or fails in one area, this can also unfairly color our expectations of them in another area.</p>
            <p>If you notice that you're giving consistently high or low marks across the board, it's worth considering that your judgment may be suffering from the halo effect.</p>
        </div>

    <section id="optimist">
        <span class="bg"></span>
        <div>
            <h2><figure></figure>9. optimism bias</h2>
            <p class="main">You overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes.</p>
            <p>There can be benefits to a positive attitude, but it's unwise to allow such an attitude to adversely affect our ability to make rational judgments (they're not mutually exclusive). Wishful thinking can be a tragic irony insofar as it can create more negative outcomes, such as in the case of problem gambling.</p>
            <p>If you make rational, realistic judgments you'll have a lot more to feel positive about.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="groups">
        <span class="bg"></span>
        <div>
            <h2><figure></figure>10. in-group bias</h2>
            <p class="main">You unfairly favor those who belong to your group.</p>
            <p>We presume that we're fair and impartial, but the truth is that we automatically favor those who are most like us, or belong to our groups. This blind tribalism has evolved to strengthen social cohesion, however in a modern and multicultural world it can have the opposite effect.</p>
            <p>Try to imagine yourself in the position of those in out-groups; whilst also attempting to be dispassionate when judging those who belong to your in-groups.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="placebo">
        <span class="bg"></span>
        <div>
            <h2><figure></figure>11. the placebo effect</h2>
            <p class="main">If you believe you're taking medicine it can sometimes 'work' even if it's fake.</p>
            <p>The placebo effect can work for stuff that our mind influences (such as pain) but not so much for things like viruses or broken bones. Things like the size and color of pills can have an influence on how strong the effect is and may even result in real physiological outcomes. We can also falsely attribute getting better to an inert substance simply because our immune system has fought off an infection i.e. we would have recovered in the same amount of time anyway.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy, acupuncture, and many other forms of natural 'medicine' have been proven to be no more effective than placebo. Keep a healthy body and bank balance by using evidence-based medicine from a qualified doctor.</p>

        <div>
            <h2><figure></figure>12. the bystander effect</h2>
            <p class="main">You presume someone else is going to do something in an emergency situation.</p>
            <p>When something terrible is happening in a public setting we can experience a kind of shock and mental paralysis that distracts us from a sense of personal responsibility. The problem is that everyone can experience this sense of deindividuation in a crowd. This same sense of losing our sense of self in a crowd has been linked to violent and anti-social behaviors. Remaining self-aware requires some amount of effortful reflection in group situations.</p>
            <p>If there's an emergency situation, presume to be the one who will help or call for help. Be the change you want to see in the world.</p>
